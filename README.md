# Python package template

This template contains:

- a very basic function and its tests
- a `.gitignore` with all the basic stuff we don't want to track
- 3 github actions:
  - format the code with `ruff`
  - run the tests with `pytest`
  - deploy documentation website with `mkdocs`
- a `pyproject.toml` with all the basic elements
- a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` which checks the formatting of the code
- a licence file (MIT)

## Set up for your package

- Click on `Use this template` and `Create a new repository`
- Clone your repo

```

- Replace info in `pyproject.toml`
- Replace all `package_name` to your actual package
- Replace all `your_name` to your Github username/organization
- Change the `LICENSE` file to your actual license (optional)
